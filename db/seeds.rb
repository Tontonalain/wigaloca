# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# require 'faker'

# puts 'Creating 10 fake wigs...'
# 10.times do
#   wig = Wig.new(
#     size: Faker::Number.decimal_part(digits: 2),
#     color: "Faker::Color.hex_color",
#     hair_style: ,
#     hair_type:
#   )
#   wig.save!
# end
# puts 'Finished!'
